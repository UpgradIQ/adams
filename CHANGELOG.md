# Changelog

Releases follow semantic versioning. Users on a clone get new releases automatically (`adams update`); plugin users get them through Claude Code's marketplace updates.

## Unreleased

- **Coming from 0.1.0?** That release had no updater, so run `git -C <your clone> pull` once (or `claude plugin marketplace update adams` for the plugin). From 2.0 on, updates are automatic.
- **Updates that reach you by themselves.** `adams update` moves a clone to the newest release tag, and a new SessionStart hook checks once a day and updates a clean clone quietly (opt out with `ADAMS_AUTO_UPDATE=0`). Plugin users enable auto-update in `/plugin` or in settings (see the README).
- **Versioned releases.** One `VERSION` file, this changelog, and a release workflow that publishes a GitHub Release when a `vX.Y.Z` tag is pushed. `scripts/release.py` cuts a release.
- **Checks on what you changed.** `adams check --changed` and `--since REF` skip untouched files, for pull requests and CI.
- **One profile per project.** `adams init` writes `.adams/config.json` so everyone shares the same rules.
- **Visible versions.** A release badge on the repository page, `adams version`, and an Updates section in the README.
- Fixed: HTML tag lines no longer count as repeated openers, and a file named README is no longer treated as a direct message.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-07)

- First public release: the Adams skill with ten modules, profiles (`default`, `strict-ar`), the `adams` CLI, hooks, plugin manifests and CI.
